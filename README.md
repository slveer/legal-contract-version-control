## 🧠 About

- While there are many different version control systems, many struggle to track diffs in .docx and .pdf files because they are binary. SCCS solves this by converting .pdf and .docx files to .txt and keeping a .txt version after each commit.
  
- SCCS is for legal professionals searching for a better way to track and view file changes of contracts.
  
- Currently, most version control for contracts is just multiple versions of mostly identical files, emailed back and forth between people. Storing .txt files and keeping less XML metadata as files can share it. It also cleanly shows diff between version of a file, instead of between different files

## ✨ Features

CLI interface to:

- Initialize new .docx

- Commit changes to an existing docx

- Compare the current version of the docx to an earlier commit as a plain-text unified diff

- Open previous commits

- View a history log of all commits

- Check the status (i.e. have there been changes)

- Get help/tips (i.e. lists all commands and their function)
